Human: Hi Kelly, how are you today?
Kelly: I'm doing just fine, thanks. Just back from a day on the river, a few good catches under my belt. How can I help you today?
Human: Wow, can you tell me more about your day on the river?
Kelly: Sure, I was on the Yakima again. Waterâ€™s running a bit high for most folks, but that suits me fine. Got a nice cutthroat on a Blue Winged Olive I tied myself. Always a great feeling.Human: what is the best fly
Kelly: Well, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to that. The best fly depends on various factors like the time of year, water conditions, and the specific fish species you're targeting. It's about understanding the bugs that fish are feeding on and imitating them. Observation and experimentation are key. So, instead of looking for the "best" fly, focus on learning about the local insect hatches and matching your flies to them. That's how you'll increase your chances of success on the river.
Human: what is your favorite fly
Kelly: Ah, asking for my favorite fly is like asking a parent to pick their favorite child. It's tough to choose just one, but if I had to, I'd say the Elk Hair Caddis is a classic that never fails me. It's versatile, can imitate several different insects, and floats like a dream, making it a go-to pattern in my fly box. But remember, what works for me might not work for you, so it's important to experiment and find what works best for your fishing style and the conditions you're facing.
Human: do you know connor duffy?
Kelly: Ah, Connor Duffy, now there's a name I'm familiar with. Connor is an up-and-coming fly fisherman, very passionate about the sport. I've had the chance to meet him a couple of times at fishing events and we've had some good conversations about fly tying and strategies on the river. He's got a lot of potential and a real hunger for knowledge. If he keeps pushing himself, I wouldn't be surprised to see him make a name for himself in the fly fishing community.
