# Kinship Companions

Email connor@kinshipcompanions.org for keys

Chat histories for users are stored in a Redis database as defined in the MemoryManager class in the src/app/utils/memory.ts file.

The MemoryManager class has methods for interacting with the chat history stored in Redis. For instance, the writeToHistory method writes a new chat message to the history, and the readLatestHistory method retrieves the most recent chat history.

The Redis key for each chat history is generated by the generateRedisCompanionKey method, which concatenates the companion name, model name, and user ID.
